# setup-tor-bridge

> NOTE: Unfortunately, Github has since closed off all ports to their hosted runners except 22, 80, and 443, which are all occupied, rendering this Action unusable. A per-runner port forwarding method may work, which is something I will look into when I have the time.

Create a temporary Tor bridge using a Github Actions runner. Useful for in-the-field operations in countries where Tor networks are censored.
